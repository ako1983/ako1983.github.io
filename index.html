  <h2>Multi-Agent LLM Framework at NBC</h2>
  <p>
    As part of my role at NBC, I worked on designing and implementing a cutting-edge 
    <strong>multi-agent framework</strong> to leverage <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> for handling complex user queries dynamically. 
    The project aimed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of conversational agents by orchestrating multiple agents for specialized tasks.
  </p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    With the rise of LLMs, managing complex workflows with diverse data sources became critical for NBC's data operations. 
    Traditional single-agent approaches were insufficient for handling multi-step tasks, such as retrieving knowledge, summarizing data, and executing SQL queries.
  </p>

  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Designed a <strong>multi-agent architecture</strong> where each agent was responsible for a specific role, such as knowledge retrieval, SQL execution, or summarization.
    </li>
    <li>
      Leveraged frameworks like <strong>LangChain</strong> and <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong> for dynamic agent orchestration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrated multiple LLMs and APIs to ensure robust responses across varied tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed fallback mechanisms to handle failures gracefully and improve user experience.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Improved query resolution time by <strong>30%</strong> through task-specific agents.
    </li>
    <li>
      Increased accuracy of responses by integrating fine-tuned retrieval models with the LLM workflow.
    </li>
    <li>
      Successfully deployed the system to support NBC's internal tools, handling thousands of queries daily.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    This project underscored the importance of modularity and collaboration between agents in scaling AI systems. 
    Future iterations will explore enhanced agent communication and self-learning mechanisms.
